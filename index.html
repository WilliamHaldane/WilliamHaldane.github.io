                        <h1> Welcome To My Website!</h1>
                        <p>
                            My name is William Haldane and I am currently a Senior computer science student at the University of St. Thomas.
                            I am currently taking three different computer science classes including, Web Development, Senior Capstone, and 
                            Database Design I. Outside of class I am working on a Microsoft Security, Identity and Compliance Fundamentals certifiation
                            and I also recently got involved with a student led and created non profit which aims to bring better software solutions 
                            and mental health outreach for college students. Here I am working mainly on front-end issues, but will get the opportunity
                            to apply many of the skills I've learned in classes and internships. My goal for my career after college is to work 
                            on meaningful and impactful projects at companies and organizations that care about creating a better future.
