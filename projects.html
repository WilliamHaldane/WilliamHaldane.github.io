                        <h3> Summer '23 Internship </h3>
                        <p> 
                            One of the first things I did as an intern over the summer was implement a variety of changes to
                            my companies Azure account. Mainly, I was tasked with configuring the IT team's Devops environment, 
                            using Azure Repos, Boards and also establishing several pipelines from previous repositories to our
                            new repository in Repos. I also collected and centralized all of our current and backed up tasks, 
                            creating a one stop shop for us and the executives to be able to track reliably. I also studied the 
                            different development team strategies and picked the one I thought would work best for our team, agile. 
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            A bulk of my experience was working with many different Microsoft Apps. I worked with Power Apps, Power Pages,
                            Power BI, and more. Power Pages is a fairly new Microsoft service that allows you to easily get the basic layout
                            of a website, skipping much of the work needed for repetative html or css. It also discards the need to worry about
                            hosting the website as it is all run, charged and secured through your Microsoft account. I worked with our full time 
                            Software Developer and another intern to bring forth the basic layout of our website using Power Pages, and then created
                            many different customizations, methods and features using CSS, html and Javascript. As I finished the summer, the website
                            was not completely finished, but I was able to start the process of learning html, Css and Javascript and gained valuable
                            insight on how working on a development team works.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Within Power Apps, I configured several different Apps for my company. The most extensive was one to help with
                            asset management. Mainly focusing on hardware tracking, I created, modified and customized a Power App that could 
                            be launched on mobile devices or via laptops/desktops. I added many custom features and tools to better help my organization
                            track their assets and then recorded my data. 
                            See Figure 1 for more.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I was also able to use Power Automate. Our data scientist was doing several different weekly reports, many of which 
                            were very labor intensive, mistake prone and repetative. With a combination of Excel scripts and Power Automate flows,
                            I was able to automate 90% of the work she was doing on these reports, freeing up her time to do more thought provoking
                            and interesting work.

                        <h3> Certifications and Education </h3>
                        <h5> Azure Certification </h5>
                        <p> 
                            Last spring I spent a few weeks learning and mastering the basics of Azure. Having no experience
                            and little understanding of cloud computing previously, I was very intested to learn more about the 
                            versatility and power that cloud computing offers. I was also able to put my certifiation to good use 
                            over the summer, working heavily within Azure.
                            See Figure 3 for more.
                        </p>
                        <h5> Stanford Online, Databases: Relational Databases & SQL </h5>
                        <p>
                            I also completed an online course through Stanford Online on relational databases and SQL.
                            Having some interst in backend and little experience, I was eager to learn more about SQL and 
                            relational databses. Through this class I attained an intermediate mastery of SQL, which I went 
                            on to built onto in my internship and now through my Database Design class.
                            See Figure 2 for more.

                        <h3> Non-profit Work </h3>
                        <h5> Seeds of Success </h5>
                        <P> 
                            In August, 2023 I had the pleasure of getting involved with a non profit startup 
                            seeking to break down barriers to mental health resources and to better the mental 
                            health resources offered specifically to students. So far, I have been able to be apart of 
                            the planning for a minimum viable product, the breakup of teams based on skills and experience 
                            and am now working as part of the front-end team. I have gained further expience in working in 
                            a development environment, and more importantly I am working on a project and issue which is 
                            extremely important. Going into the future, I will be working heavily with frameworks, web development 
                            and all things front end. I hope as time goes on I will also be working as a leader in my group as well.
