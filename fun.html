                        <h3>More About Me</h3>
                        <h5> My History </h5>
                        <p> I was born and raised in Savage, MN. My Mom is from Iowa and my dad is from 
                            California. My parents met at a mutual friend's wedding, where they fell in love 
                            and got married themselves. They lived in Auburn, CA for a couple years in the late 
                            1990s and had my older brother, Marcus. The three of them moved to Minnesota in 1999 
                            and I was born in August of 2001. Ever since I've been a young kid, I've always loved 
                            art, history, spending time outdoors, sports and mostly my friends and my family. When I 
                            was a kid, me and my brother and all of our friends ran wild around the neighborhood, building
                            forts, playing games and getting into trouble. My family often prioritized travel, so I have
                            been able to go to places like Mexico, Jamaica, The Dominican Republic, France, Italy,
                            Germany, Austria, The Netherlands, Sweden, Norway, Finland and Denmark. From this, I've been 
                            exposed to a wide variety of cultures, foods and histories. This has sparked my interest even 
                            more in all those areas and I have a huge bucket list of places I'd like to go in the future. 
                            Summer '22, my girlfriend and I did an 11 day trip to The Badlands, Black Hills, Yellowstone
                            and Glacier National Park. We had an amazing time driving through beautiful scenery and traveling
                            on our own for the first time!
                        </p>
                        <h5> My Pets </h5>
                        <p>
                            My family has two Golden Retrievers, Percy who is 12 and Oscar who is 10. We also have a cat named 
                            Pam who is 3. Having grown up with my two dogs has been a lot of fun as they're both mostly well behaved, 
                            so we can take them to a lot of different places, but also because their personalities are very different. 
                            Percy is a very well behaved, more stoic dog that seems to be wiser than most of my family, while Oscar is a 
                            hunter at heart, always getting into trouble, hunting rabbits, racoons and possoms in our backyard. He'll
                            grab the food off the table if you let him, but he's a big softy at heart, always wanting attention and pets. Pam 
                            loves to mess with Oscar, who for some reason is afriad of her. She also loves to get into things she shouldn't and 
                            loves to lay out in the sun, tanning the day away while she takes her cat naps. 
                        </p>
                        <h5>Hobbies</h5>
                        <p> 
                            Pottery has been a newer hobby of mine. I have always loved art, but when I took a few Pottery classes
                            in high school, I fell in love with it. During covid, I reached out to our pottery teacher,
                            Steven Showalter, who in his free time outside of teaching is one of the most accomplished and well known 
                            potters in the area and country. He was gracious enough to allow me to work under him for the summer of 2021
                            where I worked as his apprentice. The apprenticeship only furthered my love for pottery and I soon after bought
                            my own wheel, made some equipment and bought some clay. Since then, I have been practicing my wheel skills, in hopes
                            of selling my work in the future.
                        </p>
                        <h5>Aspirations</h5>
                        <p> 
                            As I inch closer to graduation I am hoping to not only secure a well paying, stable job, but I also want to 
                            use computer science to do meaningful and positively impactful work. I want to work for a company or startup that
                            is working viamently to better the world and contribute as much as I can to that cause. There are many issues that I am 
                            passionate about, the most of which include homelessness, mental health issues, financial equity, climate change and animal 
                            rights issues. I am currently working as part of a start-up non-profit, aiming to fight the issues in mental health outreach.
                            I hope that as I grow as a computer scientist, my tool kit and efficiency will grow as well, allowing me to tackle more issues
                            at a time and do more good for others. I have interest in starting my own non-profit or startup to help accomplish this, but for now
                            I am hoping to learn and grow in all the ways I can.
                        </p>
